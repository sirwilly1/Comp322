excerpt from STARWARS:Rise Of Someone

The Final Order fleet laying in absolute devastation, Hexigel now a waste land of broken ships ,
and thousands of loyal Final Order shock troops ready to take their lives on learning of Emperor palatines defeat. 
Rey ignoring this danger crawls over to the Emperors burnt body.
She noticed that his burnt face exposed flopping ears and bug eyes.As he was drawing his last breath .
She ask's why all this caos why all this death
Who are you really to hide behind a mask. 
With his final breath he wispers "Mesa called Jar Jar Binks, mesa your humble servant!".........Cut to black...the end.
