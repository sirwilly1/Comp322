README.md: # Comp322

Worked first try. This was by far the easiest of the assignments that was due. In this assignment we had to pretty much calculate the off set of a given virtual memory address.
To run just cd into the project dir and run
```bash
./a.out 19986
```
That should give you the address,page# and offset
